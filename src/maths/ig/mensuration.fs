// Answers may be asked for in multiples of Ï€.
// Core:
    // 1 Use current units of mass, length, area, volume
    // and capacity in practical situations and express
    // quantities in terms of larger or smaller units
        // Convert between units including units of area
        // and volume.
    // 2 Carry out calculations involving the perimeter
    // and area of a rectangle, triangle, parallelogram
    // and trapezium and compound shapes derived
    // from these.
    // 3 Carry out calculations involving the surface area
    // and volume of a cuboid, prism and cylinder.
        // Where the sector angle is a factor of 360.
    // 4 Carry out calculations involving the surface area
    // and volume of a sphere, pyramid and cone.
        // Formulae will be given for the surface area and
        // volume of the sphere, pyramid and cone in the
        // question.
    // 5 Carry out calculations involving the areas and
    // volumes of compound shapes.
